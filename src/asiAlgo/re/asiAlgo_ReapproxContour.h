//! Contour re-approximation (healing) is a common tool which is designed to
//! fix the following problems in the input wires:
//!
//! - Too many edges (e.g. a very fine chain of straight line segments);
//! - Self-interactions (overlapping and mutual intersections).
//!
//! In the modeling routines where a polygonal wire is used as an input, contour
//! healing can be necessary to improve performance and quality of the result.
//! Such healing is a three-stage process. It consists of the following phases:
//!
//! - Segmentation,
//! - Re-approximation,
//! - Join.
//!
//! Segmentation is used to break down the contour onto the pieces with
//! distinct principal directions. To do this, the input wire is exploded to
//! edges and discretized with a prescribed deflection. All near-coincident
//! points are removed to get rid of coarse self-interactions. The principal
//! directions are used for monotonic parameterization which allows elimination
//! of loops and small self-interactions at re-approximation stage. Join
//! operation is done in order to assemble a connected wire once all pieces
//! are re-approximated with respect to their principal directions. If the
//! principal directions cannot be detected (e.g. for G1 holes), the contour
//! healing procedure still can be used to eliminate small edges.
